# Polymorphism Pattern

This page walks through the **Polymorphism Pattern** end to end using the Bella Notte restaurant agent: one base project, two channel adapter cards (chat and voice), and the `cxas poly` compiler that turns them into two complete, deployable projects.

If you haven't read the concept overview yet, start with the **[Polymorphism guide](../guides/polymorphism.md)**.

---

## 1. The base agent

The base project is an ordinary SCRAPI project — nothing about it is polymorphism-specific:

```
examples/bella_notte/
├── app.json
├── gecx-config.json
├── agents/
│   ├── Bella_Notte_Host/        # root agent: routes reservation vs. takeout
│   ├── Reservation_Agent/       # slot-filling specialist
│   └── Takeout_Agent/
├── tools/                       # set_active_flow, set_reservation_basics, …
├── evaluations/                 # shared, channel-neutral goldens
└── evaluationExpectations/
```

The base instructions are written to be **channel-neutral**: they describe *what* the host does (greet, route, answer hours/location) without committing to *how* it should look on a screen or sound on a call.

---

## 2. Scaffold when adding a new channel

Bella Notte already ships `chat` and `voice` adapters, but a new channel should
usually start with the scaffold flow:

```bash
cxas poly init \
  --app-dir examples/bella_notte \
  --channel sms \
  --deployment-target TWILIO \
  --modality VOICE_ONLY \
  --with-callback before_model
```

That writes a valid `adapters/sms.adapter.yaml` plus a starter eval directory
and callback file. The generated content is intentionally generic; keep the
adapter shape, then replace the scaffolded instruction block, eval assertion,
and callback hint with real SMS behavior. The callback stub already has the
right hook-specific function name and typed signature, and the card references
it with a project-relative `pythonCode` path.

Use `--dry-run` before writing, `--force` only when replacing known scaffold
files, and `--with-tool <snake_case_name>` when the channel needs a
channel-only Python tool.

---

## 3. The chat adapter

`examples/bella_notte/adapters/chat.adapter.yaml` specializes the agent for a web chat widget:

```yaml
apiVersion: poly.cxas.dev/v1
kind: ChannelAdapter
metadata:
  channel: chat
  displayName: Bella Notte — Chat
  description: Web chat optimization: markdown, selectable lists, rich cards.

instructionDiffs:
  - agent: Bella_Notte_Host
    mode: append
    content: |
      <channel_chat>
      You are responding in a web chat widget that renders Markdown.
      - Use **bold** for emphasis and short numbered lists for options.
      - When confirming, call the send_rich_card tool to render a card.
      </channel_chat>
  - agent: Reservation_Agent
    mode: append
    content: |
      <channel_chat>
      Present available time slots as a numbered, selectable list.
      </channel_chat>

tools:
  - agent: Bella_Notte_Host
    add: [send_rich_card]

toolDefinitions:
  - displayName: send_rich_card
    toolType: python
    sourceDir: adapters/chat_tools/send_rich_card

callbacks:
  - agent: Bella_Notte_Host
    type: before_model
    pythonCode: adapters/chat_callbacks/inject_rich_content.py
    description: Inject rich card formatting hints for chat confirmations.

gecxConfig:
  model: gemini-3-pro
  modality: text

evaluations:
  - sourceDir: adapters/chat_evals

deployment:
  channelType: WEB_UI
  modality: CHAT_ONLY
  webWidgetConfig:
    theme: LIGHT
    webWidgetTitle: Bella Notte Reservations
```

Section by section:

- **`instructionDiffs`** — append a `<channel_chat>` block to the host and the reservation agent. `append` keeps all the base behavior and layers chat presentation on top.
- **`tools` + `toolDefinitions`** — make `send_rich_card` available to the host *and* bring its definition (`send_rich_card.json` + `python_code.py`) into `tools/`. The engine normalizes the tool's code path to the canonical `tools/send_rich_card/python_function/python_code.py`.
- **`callbacks`** — append a `before_model` callback. The base host already has `before_model_callbacks_01`, so this becomes `before_model_callbacks_02` automatically.
- **`evaluations`** — fold the `adapters/chat_evals/` directory into the compiled `evaluations/`.
- **`gecxConfig` + `deployment`** — fold channel runtime defaults plus a deployment block (`channel_type: WEB_UI`, `modality: CHAT_ONLY`, widget settings) into the compiled `gecx-config.json`, and set `default_channel`/`modality`.

---

## 4. The voice adapter

`examples/bella_notte/adapters/voice.adapter.yaml` tunes the same agent for telephony:

```yaml
apiVersion: poly.cxas.dev/v1
kind: ChannelAdapter
metadata:
  channel: voice
  displayName: Bella Notte — Voice

instructionDiffs:
  - agent: Bella_Notte_Host
    mode: append
    content: |
      <channel_voice>
      You are speaking on a phone call. There is no screen.
      - Keep every response to two or three short sentences.
      - Never use Markdown, bullet points, or symbols.
      - Spell out numbers and times ("six thirty in the evening").
      - Say a brief filler before tool calls so the line is not silent.
      </channel_voice>
  - agent: Reservation_Agent
    mode: append
    content: |
      <channel_voice>
      Offer at most three available times at once, spoken aloud.
      Read confirmations back field by field with a short pause between each.
      </channel_voice>

callbacks:
  - agent: Bella_Notte_Host
    type: before_model
    pythonCode: adapters/voice_callbacks/voice_pacing.py
    description: Inject voice pacing and filler-phrase hints.

gecxConfig:
  model: gemini-3-flash
  modality: audio

evaluations:
  - sourceDir: adapters/voice_evals

deployment:
  channelType: GOOGLE_TELEPHONY_PLATFORM
  modality: VOICE_ONLY
  disableBargeInControl: false
  disableDtmf: false
```

The voice adapter is almost entirely additive: it never touches the base tool list, because the base host has no chat-only tools to remove. (If a rich-card tool *were* present in the base, you'd add a `tools: [{agent: …, remove: [send_rich_card]}]` here.) It also sets voice runtime defaults in `gecxConfig`, so the compiled project carries audio modality and a voice-appropriate model before deployment.

Notice the symmetry: both adapters `append` a channel block and add a `before_model` callback, but they pull behavior in opposite directions — verbose-and-visual vs. terse-and-spoken — from the same base.

---

## 5. Validate and inspect the channels

Validate first:

```bash
cxas poly validate --app-dir examples/bella_notte
```

If validation reports an AD rule, ask for the guided form:

```bash
cxas poly doctor --app-dir examples/bella_notte
# or
cxas poly validate --app-dir examples/bella_notte --explain
```

Doctor uses the same validators as `validate`; it adds the adapter field, any
related paths, why the rule exists, and a likely fix shape.

Preview exactly what an adapter changes — without writing anything — with
`diff`. Use text for review and `--json` for CI/tooling:

```bash
cxas poly diff chat --app-dir examples/bella_notte
cxas poly diff chat --app-dir examples/bella_notte --json
```

```
Channel: chat   (adapter: adapters/chat.adapter.yaml)
Summary: 2 agent(s), 2 instruction diff(s), 1 tool add(s), 0 tool remove(s), 1 callback(s), 1 eval merge(s)

agents/Bella_Notte_Host (Bella_Notte_Host)
  instruction: + N line(s) append (agents/Bella_Notte_Host/instruction.txt)
  tools (2 -> 3):
    + send_rich_card
  callbacks: + before_model (Inject rich card formatting hints...)

tools/
  + send_rich_card (python, adapters/chat_tools/send_rich_card)

evaluations/
  + 1 item(s): Rich_Card_Confirmation

gecx-config.json (channel config)
  ~ model: gemini-3-pro

gecx-config.json (deployment)
  + channel_type: WEB_UI
  + modality: CHAT_ONLY
```

The JSON shape is versioned as `poly-diff/v1` and includes grouped `agents[]`
deltas plus a flat `deltas[]` list for simple checks.

---

## 6. Check launch readiness

When the adapters look right, run the pre-build readiness report:

```bash
cxas poly readiness --app-dir examples/bella_notte
cxas poly readiness --app-dir examples/bella_notte --format json
```

`readiness` gives you one design-partner review artifact: validation issues,
compileability, the diff summary, base/channel eval counts, duplicate eval names
that would shadow base evals in compiled output, and concrete next steps. Use
`--strict` in CI when warning-level gaps should block launch.

```
Poly readiness   2 ready, 0 attention, 0 blocked
Issues: 0 error(s), 0 warning(s)

chat (ready)   adapters/chat.adapter.yaml
  diff: 2 agent(s), 2 instruction diff(s), 1 tool add(s), 0 tool remove(s), 1 callback(s)
  evals: 33 base, 1 channel
  next: Run cxas poly build, lint the compiled output, and run channel evals.
```

---

## 7. Build the channels

```bash
cxas poly build --app-dir examples/bella_notte --output-dir ./output
```

```
Compiled channel 'chat'  -> ./output/chat
Compiled channel 'voice' -> ./output/voice

Done. 2 channel(s) written to ./output
```

Each output directory is a complete project. The chat host now lists `send_rich_card`; the voice host does not. The chat instruction carries the `<channel_chat>` block; the voice instruction carries `<channel_voice>`.

---

## 8. Lint, evaluate, and deploy the output

Because each compiled directory *is* a normal project, every existing command works on it unchanged:

```bash
# Lint each channel — both pass cleanly.
cxas lint --app-dir ./output/chat
cxas lint --app-dir ./output/voice

# Run the merged eval suite (base + channel goldens) on a channel.
cxas run --app-dir ./output/chat --eval-dir ./output/chat/evaluations

# Deploy — the compiled gecx-config.json carries the channel/modality and a
# `deployment` block (channel_type, modality, widget settings).
```

This is the payoff of the **[author once at the center](../guides/polymorphism.md#the-compilation-model)** model: you maintain a single Bella Notte agent, and the channel-specific surfaces fall out of two short adapter files.
